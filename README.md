<h3> Hi! 😊 </h3>

I'm Juliana, and I'm studying Information and Communication Technology. I'm passionate about learning and applying new technologies, and I'm currently working as an <b>intern in the Cloud area</b>.

I am motivated by new challenges, continuous learning and collaboration.

I also love video games 🎮 and music 🎵, and melting my brain with LeetCode problems 🤓.
