<h3> Hi! 😊 </h3>

I'm Juliana, an Information and Communication Technology student. I'm passionate about learning and applying new technologies, and I'm currently working as an <b>intern in Cloud Infrastructure</b>.

I am motivated by new challenges, continuous learning and collaboration.

I also love video games 🎮, music 🎵, and melting my brain with LeetCode problems 🤓.
